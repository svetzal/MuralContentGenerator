# Mural Content Generator

So I'm using this project to pick apart the clipboard copy/paste format used by the web
collaboration app [Mural](https://mural.co).

It's gonna be pretty fast moving over the next couple weeks I think.

Right now when you run the app, there will be a "Generate" button. Click that and content will be
placed on your clipboard that you can immediately paste into your open Mural board via `Cmd-v`.
